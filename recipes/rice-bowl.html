            The Rice Bowl is an ordinary dish but can be culturally upgraded to many variations.
            The dish itself consists of a base of any type of rice and any type of protein with optional veggies or sauces on the side and is considered
            to be quite the healthy meal with most of the bases covered including carbs, protein, and certain vitamins.

            <li>1/2 Cup of Rice</li>
            <li>1 pound of protein (chicken, beef, etc.)</li>
            <li>1 avocado</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the rice until cooked</li>
            <li>Fry the proteins on the pan and add whatever spices and/or sauces you'd like (I would use Japanese Barbeque Sauce).</li>
            <li>Grab your avocado and face it horizontally and start making small cuts along the avocado.</li>
            <li>After cutting it, press the avocado down to flatten the slices together.</li>
            <li>Grab your favorite bowl and apply as much rice as you want, then get the protein on there and place the avocado on the side.</li>
