# odin-recipes
This is a website using the basics of HTML to create a recipe guide.
The site includes three recipes:
- Rice Bowl
- Burger
- Pasta
As of June 23rd, 2024, the site does not have CSS styled elements to make the site look professional although this is slated to change in the near future.
This website is a demostration of the basics of HTML5 including boilerplate code, headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists as shown through the structured curriculum of the Odin Project.
